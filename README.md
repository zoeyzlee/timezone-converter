### IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT DISCREPENCY FROM CHAT GPT CONVO
- i tried implementing the more complicated features that chat gpt suggested on the 'new-features' branch, but it got very complicated and probably has 1k+ lines of code, so i decided to leave my program simpler. the correct version is in the main branch.
- all the prompts i asked chat are still valid towards my current program implementation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/timezone-converter.git
